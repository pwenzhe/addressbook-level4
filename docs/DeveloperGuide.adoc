By: `Team Bevy`      Since: `Aug 2017`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

Bevy is an application that stores and displays the user's friends.
It is a one stop location for users to view more information about their friends. +

This developer guide provides important technical information and explanations to help you get started as a Bevy contributor.
It will be useful even if you are an experienced developer.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

It is important that you have downloaded required software to support Bevy.
If not, you will not be able to run or make changes to it.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version will not be sufficient. +
Bevy will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
By default, IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
To ensure that you have enabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins`.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repository from Bevy's github page, and clone the fork to your computer to create a local repository.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.
. If you encounter any issues, please refork the repository and ensure that you have the relevant software required.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards].
IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`:
Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`, follow this order:
** import static all other imports
** import java.\*
** import javax.*
** import org.\*
** import com.*
** import all other imports
** Add a `<blank line>` between each import.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document
to configure IntelliJ to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repository, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103AUG2017-T16-B3/main` repository.
If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103AUG2017-T16-B3/main`),
you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up Continuous Integration

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Read the link:#architecture[Architecture] section to get a better understanding of how to code using the API.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

The architecture section shows how Bevy is designed and will explain the reasons needed for this structure.

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the application. The following is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* App launch: Initializes the components and connects them in the correct sequence.
* Changing theme: Changes the active theme of the app.
* Shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `InstagramBrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

The logic component executes the commands. This is the component that parses and filter the information required for Model.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  `CommandParser` parses the input for execution by `Command`
.  The fixed variable names are stored separately as indicated by the faded blue boxes that will be used by `Command` and `CommandParser`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersons1SequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.4 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

.  Following the flow of the diagram, the command `delete 1` will be sent to `LogicManager`.
.  `AddressBookParser` will parse the `delete` command and will call the `DeleteCommandParser`.
.  `DeleteCommandParser` will parse the remaining command, in this case `1` and call `DeleteCommand`.
.  `DeleteCommand` will execute the functions in the class and delete the information in `Model`.
.  After the end of execution, `DeleteCommand` will return the result to `LogicManager`.
.  `LogicManager` will then return result.

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Address Book data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.1 : Structure of the Logic Command Component_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.2 : Starting Stack of Undo/Redo_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.3 : Stack of Undo/Redo after user inputs_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.4 : Stack of Undo/Redo changes according to command_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.5 : Sequence Diagram of undo command_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.6 : Stack of Undo/Redo after clear command_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1.7 : Stack of Undo/Redo after list command_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1.8 : Activity diagram of Undo/Redo_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::sort[]
// tag::favourite[]
=== Sorting

The list will be sorted in alphabetical order whenever a new person is added.

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="300"]
_Figure 4.4.1: Sorting Sequence Diagram using addPerson_

image::SortSequenceDiagram2.png[width="300"]
_Figure 4.4.2: Sorting Sequence Diagram using updatePerson_

. Following the flow of the diagram, when a person is added or edited, the addPerson or updatePerson method will be respectively called in `AddressBook`.
. `UniquePersonList` will sort the added person by comparing the favourite status and then the names in the current list and insert the persons at the correct slot.
. The sorted contact list will then be returned.

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Type of implementation to sort contact list. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the list while new persons are added or persons are edited. +
**Pros:** More convenient for users as the list will be sorted after either input. +
**Cons:** List will only be sorted when new person is added. May cause limitation if there are commands that will mess up the order. +
**Alternative 2:** Creating a separate sort command to sort list. +
**Pros:** A command that will always allow the list to be sorted in order. +
**Cons:** It will cause inconvenience as user have to manually type in the command to sort the list whenever they add a new person or change their favourite status. +
// end::sort[]
// end::favourite[]

// tag::birthdayfield[]
=== Birthday

The birthday feature allows user to store their friends' birthdays.
Restrictions are set to ensure that the date entered is valid.
There are a few format that the user can enter the date.
The birthday class will reformat the birthday entered to ensure that the birthday saved in the contact list is standardised.
This will make it easier for users to view and also assist in executing find command for month.

After adding the birthday, users can search for a particular month and the list will show the people who were born in the same month, sorted according to the day.

The following sequence diagram shows how find works when searching for a month.

image::FindMonthSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4.1: Find Month Sequence Diagram_

. Following the flow of the diagram, the command `find m/Jan` will be sent to the `LogicManager`.
. `AddressBookParser` will parse the `find` command and call the `FindCommandParser`.
. `FindCommandParser` will parse the remaining command, in this case `m/Jan` and call `FindCommand`.
. `FindCommand` will execute and call `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
. In `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`, this is where the list is filtered to find the contacts who has their birthday in Jan.
. The list will then be returned to `LogicManager`.

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Type of implementation to find the month. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the current find command that is currently used for finding name and phone number. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement, since we only need to add a method to the class. +
**Cons:** It may make the code for find command more complicated. +
**Alternative 2:** Creating a separate find command only for searching month. +
**Pros:** Makes the code simpler and more direct as there is a command reserved for each of the command. +
**Cons:** This would make it more complicated for the user to use as there is a different command for the different search. +
// end::birthdayfield[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Birthday/ Tag Statistics

The birthday statistics will show user a table of the number of people having their birthday in each month.
While the tag statistics will show user a table of the number of people who has the same tag.

image::BirthdayStatistics.JPG[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.1: Birthday Statistics_

image::BirthdayStatisticsPanelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.2: Birthday Statistics Panel Class Diagram_

As shown from the class diagram, the birthday statistics class diagram extends the UiParts.
The birthday statistics panel will display the information when user enter the command word, `statistics`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the birthday statistics table is called.

image::BirthdayStatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.6.2: Birthday Statistics Sequence Diagram_

. Following the flow of the diagram, the command `statistics` will be sent to the `LogicManager`.
. `AddressBookParser` will parse the `statistics` command and will call the `BirthdyaStatisticsCommand`.
. This command will trigger the `HandleBirthdayStatistics` method within the `MainWindow` and `BirthdayStatisticsPanel`.
. `MainWindow` will wait for `BirthdayStatisticsPanel` to create the table through the method `setPersonData` and after that,
it will raise a `handleAddressBookChangedEvent` method and will return by raising the `ChangeInformationPanelRequestEvent` to `MainWindow`.
. `MainWindow` will show the table after the end of execution.

The implementation for tag statistics is similar to the birthday statistics.

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Command style for statistics +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a separate command for each statistics. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. Straight forward for users as each statistics has it's own command. The command alias makes it easy for users. +
**Alternative 2:** Combine both statistics as a single command and create a parse function for user to choose which statistics they would like to view. +
**Pros:** User can choose the statistics that they want to use using a single command. +
**Cons:** An additional parse function has to be written to parse the command entered. Also it may also make the command more complicated for users +

// end::statistics[]

=== Instagram/Google Map Browser Panel

image::BrowserPanels.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.1: Browser Panels UI_

The browser panels display visual information about the selected person.

image::BrowserPanelsClassDiagram.png[width="400"]
_Figure 4.7.2: Browser Panels Class Diagram_

As shown from the class diagram, both browser panels extends the UiParts. The browser panels are responsible for displaying information on the selected
person based on the person details.

The following sequence diagram shows how the browser operation works, using InstagramBrowserPanel as an exmaple:

image::InstagramPanelSequenceDiagram.png[width="400"]
_Figure 4.7.3: InstagramBrowserPanel Sequence Diagram_

As shown from the sequence diagram, when a user selects a new person, the InstagramBrowserPanel handles the new selection event and display the selected
person's Instagram based on the name in the details. For example, if the selected person's name is `Alex Yeoh`, InstagramBrowserPanel will use `AlexYeoh` as part of the URL parameter to display the person's
Instagram page.

Similarly, the GoogleMapBrowserPanel will display the map of the selected person's home location using either the postal code or the address in the person details.
For example, if the postal code is `150159`, GoogleMapBrowserPanel will use this value to display the person's location. If the postal code is not available, address will be used. For example,
if the address is `ABC 123 Street`, GoogleMapBrowserPanel will use `ABC+123+Street` as part of the URL parameter to display
the person's location.

[NOTE]
If the address contains `#` characters, GoogleMapBrowserPanel will ignore any substring after this character

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Type of implementation for Instagram +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use browser to display selected person's instagram page. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement, since the components needed is the JavaFX scene and instagram URL parameter. The user interaction
 is fully managed by the browser and instagram page itself. +
**Cons:** Some user's instagram page cannot be found using just their name. +
**Alternative 2:** Use Instagram API to construct an intergrated Instagram component +
**Pros:** Integrates well, as users can use one-time login authentication to sync with Instagram and we can find users with similar names from user's followers. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement, as there is a steep learning curve to master Instagram API. +


**Aspect:** Type of implementation for Google Map +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use browser to display selected person's location. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement, since the componenets needed is the JavaFX scene and Google Map URL parameter. The user interaction
is fully managed by the browser and Google Map page itself. +
**Cons:** We can not customise the visual display of Google Map. +
**Alternative 2:** Use Google Map API to construct an intergrated Google Map component +
**Pros:** Integrates well, as we can simplify the experience for users. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement, as there is a steep learning curve to master Google Map API. +

// tag::deleteMultiplePersons[]
=== Delete Multiple Persons

The Delete mechanism has been extended to support deleting multiple persons.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

image::DeletePersons1-3SequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.7.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1-3` Command_

Below is a detailed explanation of the extension.

. Following the flow of the diagram, the command `delete 1-3` will be sent to the `LogicManager`.
. `AddressBookParser` will parse the `delete` command and call the `DeleteCommandParser`.
. `DeleteCommandParser` will parse the index ranges into a list of `IndexRange` class using the `ParserUtil`, where each `IndexRange`
object contains the start and end index of each range.
. This list will then be converted into a `HashSet` of indexes, which
will be used to construct a `DeleteCommand`. `HashSet` prevents the duplicates of indexes.
. `DeleteCommand` will execute and a sub list of person to delete will be produced to delete the person information in `Model`.
. `DeleteCommand` will generate the result and return it.

**Aspect:** Type of implementation for storing index range +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `IndexRange` class to store the start and end index of index range. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement, a list of `IndexRange` can be constructed to store each index range +
**Cons:** Some index may not be a range, therefore does not need the `IndexRange` class +
**Alternative 2:** Directly parse the index ranges into a list of integers +
**Pros:** Index that are not a range can be directly passed into this list. +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement, duplicates of index will occur and requires iterating through the list and adding into a `HashSet`
 to remove duplicates +

// tag::dynamicInformationPanel[]
=== Dynamic Information Panel

The information panel has the capability of changing panel depending on the request event. Home, select and help command are the current commands
that will raise `ChangeInformationPanelRequestEvent()`.

Below are the respective commands and their requested panel.

. *Home Command*: Request home panel.
. *Select Command*: Request selected person's information panel.
. *Help Command*: Request help panel.
. *Birthday Statistics Command*: Request birthday statistics panel.
. *Tag Statistics Command*: Request tag statistics panel.

The sequence diagram below shows how the panel are changed based on the command entered, using home command as an example.

// end::export[]

// tag::changetheme[]
=== Changing Themes

The theme of the application can be changed via a request event. The `changetheme` command raises the `ChangeThemeRequestEvent()`. There are two themes, namely dark and bright. +

The sequence diagram below shows how the theme is changed.

image::ThemeSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.12.1 ThemeCommand Sequence Diagram_

From the sequence diagram, this operation extends into the Model and UI components.

Below is a detailed explanation of the extension.

. The `changetheme` command is sent to the `AddressBookParser` then calls on the `ThemeCommand`.
. `ThemeCommand` posts a `ChangeThemeRequestEvent()` which will be received by the `MainApp`.
. `MainApp` then calls the `changeTheme()` from `UiManager`.
. `UiManager` invokes the `MainWindow` to change the CSS files active accordingly.
. `UiManager` then updates the `UserPref` with the theme preference.

==== Design Consideration

**Aspect:** Type of implementation to change and store theme. +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make a new command that changes and stores the theme. +
**Pros:** Lets the user change the theme and automatically saves it under preferences. +
**Cons:** Code for the theme command involves 3 different components and can be messy.  +
**Alternative 2:** Creating a separate command for changing theme and saving the theme. +
**Pros:** Makes the code simpler with different commands using lesser components. +
**Cons:** It is less convenient for the user as it requires an additional input for saving the theme. +

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI], https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor], https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] and https://www.codacy.com/[Codacy] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on Bevy. +

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/592/files[PR] for the full solution.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/596/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
