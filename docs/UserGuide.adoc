_Figure 1.1 Bevy UI_

Have you ever forgotten that special friend's birthday? Or the name of that friend you just spoke to?

In today's globalised world, we are making more friends than we can ever imagine, but
at the same time, we are losing many of them because of our forgetfulness. If that is you, don't worry,
we have just the solution for you.

Introducing Bevy, a powerful app that helps you to remember your friends again. It simplifies your friends' information in a
single place and provides more. Bevy is smart to know what your friends are up to in their social media, gives
you a sneak peek into their location, and even provides statistical analysis for you.

Excited? We are too, because we *love* connecting you with Bevy.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and copy the `data` folder, `config.json` and `preferences.json` files from
your previous application folder and put them into the same location as you placed the application in the other
computer.

*Q*: I do not see the correct Instagram page of my friend, what should I do? +
*A*: The Instagram display uses your friend's name as the account name.
If your friend uses a different account name, it might show the incorrect page.

*Q*: Why am I able to add another friend with the same details? +
*A*: Please check that all fields are the same. Bevy allows adding of a similar person even if they are only a letter apart,
because we know you have many friends.

*Q*: I tried to undo and then redo a delete command and it seems to have deleted the wrong people, what should I do? +
*A*: Use the undo command again to revert the delete. The redo command might not delete the same people as you originally intended
as it merely executes the written command. If the list of people shown has changed between deleting and redoing the delete, the index
used for the redone deletion might result in the wrong people being deleted.

*Q*: My question is not on the FAQ list, what can I do? +
*A*: Please do not hesitate to link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/AboutUs.adoc[email] us for any questions or comments.

*Q*: Where do I find the export file after entering the export command? +
*A*: The file is named `Bevy.csv` and will be created in the same location as your Bevy app.
