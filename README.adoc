Have you ever forgotten that special friend's birthday? Or that name of the friend you just spoke to?

In today's globalised world, we are making more friends than we can ever imagine, but
at the same time, we are losing many of them because of our forgetfulness. If that is you, don't worry,
we have just the solution for you.

Introducing Bevy, a powerful app that helps you to remember your friends again. It simplifies your friends' information in a
single place and provide more. Bevy is smart to know what your friends are up to in their social media, gives
you a sneak peek into their location and even does statistics analysis for you.

Excited? We are too, because we *love* connecting you with Bevy.
