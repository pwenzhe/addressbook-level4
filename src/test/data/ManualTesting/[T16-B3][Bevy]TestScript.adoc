Bevy will save the entered date in a standard format (eg. 23 06 89 will be saved as 23 Jun 1989).

. *Postal Code* +
The postal code can be specified by the user using the prefix `pc/`.
If it is not specified, Bevy will extract the postal code directly if the address contains a 6 digit number.

. *Favourite* +
The person marked as favourite will be pin to the top of the list with a yellow star, sorted in alphabetical order.
Specify `yes` or `no` after the `f/` prefix to indicate if a person is a favourite.
